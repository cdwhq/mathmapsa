Installing MathMap
==================

This version of MathMap has only been tested on Linux and will
probably not work on other operating systems without some adjustments.
We provide packages for several Linux distributions as well as
versions for Windows and MacOS X.  Is is recommended that you use
these rather than compiling MathMap yourself, if possible.  They are
available on the MathMap homepage:

    http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/mathmap/


Requirements
------------

MathMap requires the following software packages, including
development packages, to compile and run:

  * The GIMP 2.4 or higher
  * GSL (GNU Scientific Library), including GSL CBLAS
  * fftw3
  * libgtksourceview 2.0
  * libjpeg, libpng, libgif (preferred) or libungif
  * gettext
  * libtool
  * doxygen


Configuration
-------------

Edit the Makefile if necessary.  The reasons you might want to do this
are:

  * You have libungif instead of libgif installed
  * You don't want to build the command-line interface
  * You're building on MacOS X
  * You have more than one version of GIMP installed


Compiling
---------

After you are finished with the Makefile, just type

	make

If it does not work, the most probable cause is that you don't have
all the required packages (see above) installed.  Consult the
documentation of your Linux distribution or whatever you have on how
to install packages.  The packages you're looking for are probably
called something like "gimp-devel" or "libgimp-dev", or just "gimp".


Installation
------------

To install MathMap for all users on your machine, type

	sudo make install

or, if you don't have sudo, become root and type

	make install

If you have any problems with this process, feel free to contact me.
