    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <blockquote>
      I herein propose a type system for the
      <a href="index.html">MathMap GIMP Plug-In</a>, which will solve most
      of the shortcomings of the current system.

      I sincerely ask you to <a href="mailto:schani@complang.tuwien.ac.at">mail me</a>
      what you think about this proposal,
      especially if you find any weaknesses in the system, so that I can
      revise the design before I begin implementing it.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <blockquote>
      MathMap has no type system: everything is treated as a double
      precision floating point number, be it a multiplication factor, a
      coordinate or a color. While this has the obvious advantages of
      being easy to implement and of being reasonably efficient, it has
      some several drawbacks:

      <ul>
	<li>It is inflexible. The GIMP is planned to have more types of samples
	  than just 8 bit integer. It is impossible to incorporate four (RGBA) single
	  precision floating point numbers in one double precision number without losing
	  accuracy.

	<li>It does not provide suitable levels of abstraction. If I decided to
	  provide HSV support in MathMap, the HSV values had to be treated using
	  different functions than the RGB values, i.e. I had to provide two functions
	  to extract the brightness of a pixel: one for RGB pixels and one for
	  HSV pixels. The other approach I could chose is to provide conversion
	  functions from HSV to RGB and vice versa. Both solutions incur overhead
	  to the user.

	<li>It is sometimes awkward to use. In order to make a pixel darker, one has
	  to write <tt>rgbColor(red(p)*f,green(b)*f,blue(p)*f)</tt>.
	  It should ideally be possible to do the same with <tt>p*f</tt>.
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>

    <blockquote>
      I propose to implement a simple type system in MathMap, providing
      tupes of floating point numbers of arbitrary length with
      associated tags. Such tagges tuples can be composed, decomposed,
      passed as values to functions, returned by functions and converted
      to tuples of another type. Simple numbers are represented as tuples
      of length 1.

      Values which are represented as types are pixels (RGB, HSV),
      coordinates (cartesian, polar), vectors for scalar operations
      (addition, multiplication) and simple numbers.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Tags</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Tags are needed in order to distinguish types, like RGB and HSV
      pixels. The special tag <tt>nil</tt> is used to denote numbers
      or vectors which are used for scalar operations.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>The Syntax</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Constructing a tagged tuple is as simple as writing a number:
      <tt>0</tt> constructs a tuple of length 1 with the tag
      <tt>nil</tt>. Tuple of other lengths can be constructed using a
      vector notation: <tt>[1,2]</tt> constructs a tuple of length two
      with the tag <tt>nil</tt>. In order to give a tuple a tag other
      than <tt>nil</tt>, the casting operator <tt>:</tt> must be used:
      the expression <tt>xy:[3,4]</tt> returns a tuple with the tag
      <tt>xy</tt>.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Overloaded functions and operators can be selected based on the
      tags of their operands.

      Example: In order to fetch the value of a pixel in the original
      image, only one function, <tt>origVal</tt> would be needed, which,
      depending on the tag of its operand would do a lookup in either
      the cartesian or the polar coordinate system.

      Likewise, arithmetic operators can be overloaded to do
      e.g. complex arithmetic for polar coordinates. The special case of
      at least one operand having the tag <tt>nil</tt> is resolved by
      element-wise application of the operator if the tuples have the
      same length, or the <tt>nil</tt>-tuple has length 1. Example: the
      angular part of a polar coordinate can be incremented by one
      through addition of the <tt>nil</tt>-tuple <tt>[0,1]</tt>, i.e.
      <tt>ri:[2,3]+[0,1]</tt> yields <tt>ri:[2,4]</tt>, while
      <tt>xy:[1,2]*2</tt> has the result <tt>xy:[2,4]</tt>.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Tag conversion</h2>

    <blockquote>
      A second operator, namely the conversion operator (<tt>::</tt>) is
      introduced. It converts a tuple with one tag to a tuple with
      another tag. To convert polar to cartesian coordinates, one would
      write <tt>xy::(ra:[1,2])</tt>.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Efficiency</h2>

    <blockquote>
      There are two bottlenecks for the efficiency of MathMap: the GIMP
      plug-in interface and the stack-machine interpreter. While tagged
      tuples have no effect on the former, they do affect the
      latter. The performance of an evaluation by the interpreter
      depends mainly on the number of instructions the interpreter has
      to execute. Since tagged tuples can perform operations in one
      instruction which would now require more than one instruction,
      performance is likely to increase.

      While a performance penalty could result from resolving
      polymorphism, I avoid this penalty by requiring that the tuple
      tags and lengths of all expressions can be determined statically.
      This means that expressions like <tt>if condition then [1,2] else
	[3,4,5] end</tt> are illegal.
