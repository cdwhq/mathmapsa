    <center><h1>The MathMap GIMP Plug-In</h1></center>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      MathMap is a <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> plug-in
      which allows distortion of images specified by mathematical
      formulae. For each pixel in the generated image, an expression
      is evaluated which should return a pixel value. The expression
      can either refer to a pixel in the source image or can generate
      pixels completely independent of the source.

      <p>If you have any suggestions, bugs to report, expressions
      which generate cool effects, or if you just happen to like or
      dislike this plug-in, in other words, under any circumstances,
      please <a href="mailto:schani@complang.tuwien.ac.at">drop me a
      mail</a>.

    <h2>Bugs and Deficiencies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The coordinate system is fixed: the origin is always at the
	center of the image and a unit is always a pixel.

      <li>Tuples are limited to a size of 9 in the interpreter.
    </ul>

<!--
    <h2>What's to come</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I'll try to fix all the bugs.</li>

      <li>I'll let the user specify the coordinate system (origin, scale).

      <li>I will make it possible for the user to modify the Examples
	tree from within the plug-in in a user-friendly fashion.
	
      <li>I will add a few optimizations to the code generator.
    </ul>
-->

    <h2>How you can contribute</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Play around with MathMap. If you have any suggestions, mail
        me. If you find any bugs, try to reproduce them and mail me
	a bug report or, better yet, try to fix them yourself and mail
	me a patch if you succeed.

      <li>Write cool MathMap expressions and mail them to me.

      <li>If you want a particular feature, mail me or implement it
        yourself and send me the patch.
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to get it</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <h3>Stable Release</h3>

      <blockquote>
        The latest stable MathMap release is <a
        href="mathmap-0.14.tar.gz">MathMap 0.14</a>.  I won't add any
        new features to the stable branch, but will instead release
        version 1.0.0 when I'm confident that most bugs have been
        fixed.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Unstable/Development Release</h3>

      <blockquote>
        The latest development release if <a
        href="mathmap-1.1.0.tar.gz">MathMap 1.1.0</a>.  It probably
        has lots of bugs, so use it at your own risk.
      </blockquote>


      <h3>Requirements</h3>

      <blockquote>
        MathMap requires the following software packages to compile:

	<ul>
	  <li><tt>bison</tt> and <tt>flex</tt>.  These are included in
	    nearly any sane operating system distribution.

	  <li><a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/"><tt>GSL</tt>, the GNU Scientific Library</a>.

	  <li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> 1.2 or 2.0.  The
            last version that runs with GIMP 1.0 is <a
            href="mathmap-0.10.tar.gz">MathMap 0.10</a>.
        </ul>
